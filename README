Requires python and openpyxl.

Examples:

Imagine we have two CSV files, lol.csv and wut.csv:

~$ cat lol.csv
Name,Date,Score
Jimmy,2012-10-10,17
Rustle,2015-10-01,45
The Guru,2016-04-30,-2

~$ cat wut.csv
Id,Color,Hex #
1,red,#f00
2,green,#0f0
3,blue,#00f

We can convert a single csv file into an xlsx like so:
~$ csv2xlsx -f lol.csv lol.xlsx

The resulting file will have a single tab named sheet_0 with three columns,
Name, Date, and Score.

If you would like to give the sheet a name, you do it like so:
~$ csv2xlsx -f lol.csv -n lol lol.xlsx

The resulting file will have a single tab named lol with three columns, Name,
Date, and Score.

You can also merge multiple csv files as follows:
~$ csv2xlsx -f lol.csv -f wut.csv combined.xlsx

If you have multiple files and want to name a tab, you must name all of them
(the count of files and names must match):
~$ csv2xlsx -f lol.csv -n lol -f wut.csv -n wut combined.xlsx
